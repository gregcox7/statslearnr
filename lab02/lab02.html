<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><img src="images/simpsons.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>In the previous activity, we got some exposure to how we can explore
data in R in such a way that we can use data to help answer questions.
In this activity, we will get a sense of where data come from and how
the processes that produce data can force us to change how we interpret
that data.</p>
<p>Generally, the data we have come from a <strong>sample</strong> from
some larger <strong>population</strong>. Depending on how that sample is
selected, it may give us a <strong>biased</strong> perspective on the
larger population. In particular, when we have non-random samples (as in
<strong>observational studies</strong>), we must think carefully about
how the processes by which cases end up in our sample. If those
processes, which might be social in nature, introduce
<strong>confounding variables</strong>, then there can be systematic
differences between different groups in our sample, requiring us to
interpret the data differently.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-sex-bias-sampling-bias-or-both" class="section level2">
<h2>Sex Bias, Sampling Bias, or Both?</h2>
<p>In 1973, the University of California at Berkeley noted a disturbing
fact about their graduate school admissions: considerably more male
applicants were being admitted than female applicants. The University,
fearing a lawsuit, wanted to know if this reflected systematic sex
discrimination in their admissions offices. We shall see for ourselves
that the story turned out to be more complex (for the full details,
check out the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1739581">original
article</a>). For now, keep in mind that this sample is <em>not
random</em> because applicants, by definition, select themselves into
the sample.</p>
<div id="section-check-out-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Check out the data</h3>
<p>Let’s first take a look at the raw data. These are loaded into R
under the name <code>berkeley</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(berkeley)</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["Admit"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Gender"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Department"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"Rejected","2":"Female","3":"F"},{"1":"Rejected","2":"Male","3":"B"},{"1":"Admitted","2":"Female","3":"C"},{"1":"Rejected","2":"Male","3":"D"},{"1":"Admitted","2":"Female","3":"E"},{"1":"Rejected","2":"Male","3":"A"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>Each row of the data refers to a specific applicant in 1973. For each
applicant, there are three observed variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Admit</strong>: Either “Admitted” or “Rejected”, depending
on whether the applicant was admitted or rejected.</li>
<li><strong>Gender</strong>: Either “Male” or “Female”.</li>
<li><strong>Department</strong>: A letter between “A” and “F” that
identifies the academic department to which the applicant applied. The
actual department names were obscured for privacy.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong></p>
<p>For each variable in this dataset, identify what type it is (one of
nominal categorical, ordinal categorical, numerical).</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="section-are-more-males-than-females-admitted"
class="section level3">
<h3>Are more males than females admitted?</h3>
<p>As noted above, Berkeley was concerned because a greater
<strong>proportion</strong> of their male applicants were being admitted
than their female applicants. To verify whether this is true, let’s find
those proportions ourselves by running the following chunk of code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>berkeley %&gt;%
  group_by(Gender, Admit) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;Gender&#39;. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["Gender"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Admit"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["n"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["p"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Female","2":"Admitted","3":"557","4":"0.3035422"},{"1":"Female","2":"Rejected","3":"1278","4":"0.6964578"},{"1":"Male","2":"Admitted","3":"1198","4":"0.4451877"},{"1":"Male","2":"Rejected","3":"1493","4":"0.5548123"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>The rightmost column of the table (labeled <code>p</code>) gives the
proportion of applicants of each gender who were either admitted or
rejected. Based on this table, it looks like Berkeley was right to be
concerned—the proportion of male applicants admitted is higher than the
proportion of female applicants admitted.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong></p>
<p>Consider the structure of the chunk of code we just ran, which is
identical to how we made tables of frequencies and proportions in the
previous activity.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>___ %&gt;%
  group_by(___) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n))</code></pre>
<p>For each of the four lines of code above, describe in your own words
what is the purpose of that line.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="section-is-there-a-bias-in-all-departments"
class="section level3">
<h3>Is there a bias in all departments?</h3>
<p>Even if there is an overall bias, is this the case for all
departments, or just some?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong></p>
<p>Make a new table that gives the proportion of male and female
applicants admitted for each department. You may find it helpful to fill
in the blanks in the following chunk of code (note a new line at the end
which “filters” out some redundant rows of the table to make it from
being too long). Remember that you can use the “Submit Answer” button to
check your work.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="department_admit"
data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>___ %&gt;%
  group_by(___, ___, Admit) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n)) %&gt;%
  filter(Admit == &quot;Admitted&quot;)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":true,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Based on the table you just made, which departments admit a higher
proportion of female applicants than male applicants? Which departments
admit a higher proportion of male applicants than female applicants?</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="section-resolving-the-paradox-tables" class="section level3">
<h3>Resolving the paradox: Tables</h3>
<p>We appear to have a paradox on our hands: If we ignore differences
between departments, it is more likely that a male applicant gets
admitted than a female applicant. But within most departments, the
opposite is true: a greater proportion of female applicants are admitted
than male applicants. In other words, there seems to be a
<strong>confounding variable</strong> at work, and it is related to the
differences between departments.</p>
<p>To try to figure out what this confound might be, we should look at
two additional issues. The first issue is, for each department, what
proportion of their applicants are female, regardless of whether they
were admitted or not?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong></p>
<p>Modify the following chunk of code to produce a table that gives the
proportion of applicants for each department who were either male or
female.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="gender_apply"
data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>___ %&gt;%
  group_by(___, ___) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n))</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":true,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Based on the table you just produced, which departments receive
(regardless of whether they are admitted) more male than female
applicants? Is there any overlap between these departments and those you
identified in the previous exercise as admitting a higher proportion of
female than male applicants?</p>
<hr />
<p>The second issue to consider is the overall rate of admission for
each department.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 5</strong></p>
<p>Make a table that shows the proportion of applicants who were
admitted for each department, regardless of gender. You may find it
useful to modify the chunk of code you just used.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="admit_apply"
data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>___ %&gt;%
  group_by(___, ___) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n))</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":true,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>For each department, compare the proportion of applicants admitted to
the proportion of applicants who are female (which you found in the last
exercise). Describe any relationship between those two proportions that
you might see.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="section-resolving-the-paradox-bar-charts"
class="section level3">
<h3>Resolving the paradox: Bar charts</h3>
<p>Finally, let’s create a visualization that may help us put these
pieces together.</p>
<p>Use the chunk of code below to produce a set of bar charts. Make a
different <em>facet</em> for each department. Within each “facet”, use
<code>Admit</code> as the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
variable. We will also use a new “aesthetic”: use the
<code>Gender</code> variable to <code>fill</code> in the bars with
different colors.</p>
<p>When you make your plot, the total height of each bar will represent
the total number of applicants for each department who were either
admitted or rejected. Each bar will be divided into two parts in
different colors, representing the numbers of male and female applicants
in each bar. (Remember to check your code using the “Submit Answer”
button below before continuing.)</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="berkeley_bar"
data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>___ %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = ___, fill = ___)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(&quot;___&quot;)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":true,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-putting-it-all-together" class="section level3">
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>With the plot you just made, you can use the total height of each bar
to see the relative number of people who were admitted vs. rejected in
each department. You can use the amount of red vs. teal in each panel to
see the relative number of female vs. male applicants for each
department.</p>
<p>Putting the pieces together, we have found the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Across all departments, the proportion of female applicants admitted
is <em>lower</em> than the proportion of male applicants admitted.</li>
<li>Within most departments, the proportion of female applicants
admitted is <em>higher</em> than the proportion of male applicants
admitted.</li>
<li>Departments with high overall admission rates receive fewer female
applicants than departments with low admission rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we should note that, although the names of the specific
departments have been removed, departments A and B (which were easy to
get into and received predominantly male applicants) were in the
physical sciences and engineering whereas departments E and F (which
were hard to get into and received considerably more female applicants)
were in the social sciences and humanities.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 6</strong></p>
<p>Even though these results do not suggest a sex bias in admissions at
the level of individual departments, what other kinds of bias do these
results suggest might be going on? How are these potential biases
related to the types of sampling biases we’ve discussed in class and in
the book?</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-wrap-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>The paradox we confronted in this activity has a name:
“<strong>Simpson’s Paradox</strong>”. Check out a good video
demonstration of the paradox <a
href="https://youtu.be/ebEkn-BiW5k">here</a>.</p>
<p>Simpson’s Paradox occurs whenever a pattern that appears in aggregate
(like the bias against female applicants over all departments)
disappears or reverses when we look at different subgroups (like the
apparent bias in favor of female applicants within most departments). As
we have done in this activity, Simpson’s Paradox can be resolved only by
careful exploration of the data and consideration of potential
confounding variables that are associated with different subgroups.
