<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><img src="images/rats.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>This session is divided into two parts. In the first, we will use R
to understand how two measures of <em>variability</em> work: the
<strong>standard deviation</strong> and its close cousin, the
<strong>variance</strong>. We will see how valuable the computer can be
to quickly produce both numerical and visual summaries of data.</p>
<p>But while computers are great at mind<em>less</em> computation, that
means us people have to be better at mind<em>ful</em> stuff. We need to
think about what these numbers mean and why they may be important for
understanding the world.</p>
<p>In the second part of the session we will analyze data from an
experiment. We will use both visual and numerical summaries to help draw
conclusions about what was going on in the experiment.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-variance-and-standard-deviation"
class="section level2">
<h2>Variance and standard deviation</h2>
<p>Two important and widely-used numerical summaries of variability are
<strong>variance</strong> and <strong>standard deviation</strong>.
Although they have two different names, they are really two ways of
looking at the same thing. The standard deviation is more often used as
a summary of variability, although we shall see that variance is useful
for other purposes later in this course.</p>
<p>These summaries involve a somewhat long chain of calculations. It is
important to see this chain to understand what these numbers are telling
us. In this part of the session, we will use R to find the variance and
standard deviation of some simple simulated data. First, we will follow
that long chain. Then, we will see how to find these summaries more
quickly and efficiently.</p>
<div id="section-the-big-picture" class="section level3">
<h3>The big picture</h3>
<p>A good numerical summary of variability should tell us how much we
would expect the observed values of a variable to differ from what is
“typical”. This is what “standard deviation” means: it is a summary of
the typical (“standard”) amount by which observed values of some
variable tend to differ (“deviate”) from their central tendency. The
variance and standard deviation are based on using the <em>mean</em> to
describe central tendency.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-check-out-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Check out the data</h3>
<p>To see how the variance and standard deviation are calculated, let’s
create a very small fake data set, which we will creatively call
<code>my_data</code>. It contains 5 observations of a single variable
called “X”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_data</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["X"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"91"},{"1":"102"},{"1":"107"},{"1":"109"},{"1":"111"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>Although these data are not real, they are similar to what one might
observe in a random sample of IQ scores (which have a mean of 100 and
standard deviation of 15 in the typical population).</p>
<p>We will now follow the chain of calculations, step by step, that
results in finding the variance and then the standard deviation of a set
of observed values like we have for the “X” variable in our simulated
data.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-step-1-find-the-mean" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 1: Find the mean</h3>
<p>First, we find the mean of the observed values. As we’ve seen, R can
be used as a fancy calculator. So we could find the mean of the observed
values on the <code>X</code> variable by plugging the values into the
formula for the mean that we’ve already learned:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(91 + 102 + 107 + 109 + 111) / 5</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 104</code></pre>
<p>While using R as a calculator has its advantages over doing it by
hand, the downside is that we still have to type/copy those numbers.
Moreover, if we wanted to use the result for something else (which we
will), we’d have to copy that too, and the more we do this, the greater
the chances are that we make a mistake.</p>
<p>Rather than typing in the numbers manually, we can instead use R’s
<code>mean</code> function within the “summarize” line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_data %&gt;%
    summarize(mean(X))</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["mean(X)"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"104"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong></p>
<p>When we’ve used the “summarize” function in previous sessions, we
always preceded it with a <code>group_by</code> line. Say in your own
words why we didn’t use a <code>group_by</code> line to find the mean in
the chunk of code we just ran.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="section-step-2-find-the-deviations-from-the-mean"
class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2: Find the deviations from the mean</h3>
<p>The next step is to find, for each observed value in our data, its
<strong>deviation</strong> from the mean. In mathematical notation, the
deviation for the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th observation
can be written as <span class="math inline">\((x_i - \bar{x})\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> is a shorthand for the
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th observed value and <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is the mean.</p>
<p>In previous sessions, we’ve used the <code>mutate</code> line to
transform counts into proportions. Now we will use it to find the
deviations:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_data %&gt;%
    mutate(deviation = X - mean(X))</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["X"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["deviation"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"91","2":"-13"},{"1":"102","2":"-2"},{"1":"107","2":"3"},{"1":"109","2":"5"},{"1":"111","2":"7"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-step-3-square-the-deviations" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 3: Square the deviations</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve found the deviations, we square each of them, again
using a <code>mutate</code> line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_data %&gt;%
    mutate(deviation = X - mean(X)) %&gt;%
    mutate(squared_deviation = deviation^2)</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["X"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["deviation"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["squared_deviation"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"91","2":"-13","3":"169"},{"1":"102","2":"-2","3":"4"},{"1":"107","2":"3","3":"9"},{"1":"109","2":"5","3":"25"},{"1":"111","2":"7","3":"49"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>Note that, in R, the caret symbol <code>^</code> is used for
exponentiation.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-step-4-add-up-the-squared-deviations"
class="section level3">
<h3>Step 4: Add up the squared deviations</h3>
<p>Now, we add up the squared deviations using the <code>sum</code>
function as part of a <code>summarize</code> line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_data %&gt;%
    mutate(deviation = X - mean(X)) %&gt;%
    mutate(squared_deviation = deviation^2) %&gt;%
    summarize(sum_squared_deviation = sum(squared_deviation))</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">

  </script>
</div>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong></p>
<p>Modify the chunk of code we just ran to just add up the
<code>deviation</code>s instead of the <code>squared_deviation</code>s.
(<em>Hint:</em> think about what variable name to put inside the
parentheses after “sum” on the last line.)</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>Step 5: Divide by <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> to get

<p>The <strong>variance</strong> is the sum of squared deviations
divided by <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of observed values, the
“sample size”. To get <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we can
include <code>n = n()</code> in the <code>summarize</code> line and then
use another <code>mutate</code> line to get the variance:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_data %&gt;%
    mutate(deviation = X - mean(X)) %&gt;%
    mutate(squared_deviation = deviation^2) %&gt;%
    summarize(sum_squared_deviation = sum(squared_deviation), n = n()) %&gt;%

<h3>Step 6: Take the square root to get the standard deviation</h3>
<p>Finally, we get the <strong>standard deviation</strong> by taking the
square root of the variance, which we do with a final
<code>mutate</code> line. In R, the <code>sqrt</code> function stands
for <code>sq</code>uare <code>r</code>oo<code>t</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_data %&gt;%
    mutate(deviation = X - mean(X)) %&gt;%

</div>
</div>
<div id="section-all-steps-at-once" class="section level3">
<h3>All steps at once</h3>
<p>We just saw the complete chain of calculations involved in finding
the variance and then the standard deviation. But as you might have
guessed from the fact that R has a <code>mean</code> function, it also
has functions that directly calculate variances and standard deviations.
These functions are called <code>var</code> and <code>sd</code>,
respectively, and we can use them in a <code>summary</code> line, like
so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_data %&gt;%
    summarize(mean = mean(X), variance = var(X), standard_deviation = sd(X))</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["mean"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["variance"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["standard_deviation"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"104","2":"64","3":"8"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>The code we just ran is much more compact, readable, and less liable
to lead to any typos, so naturally we will use the built-in
<code>var</code> and <code>sd</code> functions pretty often!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong></p>
<p>Take a look at how we used the <code>mutate</code> and
<code>summarize</code> lines when we were calculating the variance and
standard deviation step-by-step. In your own words, describe a basic
difference between what a <code>mutate</code> line is used for and what
a <code>summarize</code> line is used for.</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> Think about the result we got after adding either a
<code>mutate</code> or <code>summarize</code> line and how it affected
the number of rows and/or columns in the result.</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-diet-and-lifespan" class="section level2">
<h2>Diet and Lifespan</h2>
<p>Having seen how to use R to calculate numerical summaries of central
tendency and variability, let’s see how they operate in real data. The
data we will be looking at come from a study by <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1093/geronj/37.2.130">Byung Pal Yu and their
colleagues</a>. They studied the lifespan of a sample of rats which were
randomly assigned to one of two different diets: One group of rats was
allowed to eat freely, however they wanted; another group was fed on a
restricted diet with only about 60% of the calories that the free-eating
rats had.</p>
<div id="section-check-out-the-data-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Check out the data</h3>
<p>The data from this study are stored under the name
<code>rats</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(rats)</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["Diet"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Lifespan"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Free","2":"89"},{"1":"Free","2":"104"},{"1":"Free","2":"387"},{"1":"Free","2":"465"},{"1":"Free","2":"479"},{"1":"Free","2":"494"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>As you can see, there are just two variables in this dataset,
<strong>Diet</strong> and <strong>Lifespan</strong> (measured in days).
Diet is the explanatory variable and Lifespan is the response
variable.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-histograms" class="section level3">
<h3>Histograms</h3>
<p>Although numerical summaries like the mean, variance, and standard
deviation are important, they should always be accompanied by visual
summaries in order to get a more complete understanding of the data.</p>
<p>Let’s make a facetted histogram that shows the distribution of
lifespans of the rats under each diet. We will use an option under
<code>facet_wrap</code> that lets us set the <code>n</code>umber of
<code>col</code>umns (<code>ncol</code>) so we can see the facets
stacked atop one another.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rats %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(x=Lifespan)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth=90) +
    facet_wrap(&quot;Diet&quot;, ncol = 1)</code></pre>
<p><img src="lab03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong></p>
<p>First, let’s describe what we can see from the histograms (you may
also try out other bin widths for the histograms as you like).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Describe the shape of the two distributions. Be sure to note the
number of <em>modes</em>, any <em>skewness</em>, and whether there may
be any <em>outliers</em> in either group.</li>
<li>Compare the two distributions. Be sure to note whether there seem to
be any differences in <em>central tendency</em> or <em>variability</em>
between the two groups.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="section-boxplots" class="section level3">
<h3>Boxplots</h3>
<p>We’ve also seen some examples of <strong>boxplots</strong> as useful
visual summaries of data. The “box” of the boxplot encloses the
“inter-quartile range” (IQR), that is, the middle 50% of the data that
falls between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The line in the middle of
the box shows where the median is. Boxplots are easy to produce in R by
using <code>geom_boxplot</code> instead of
<code>geom_histogram</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rats %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(x=Lifespan, y=Diet)) +
    geom_boxplot()</code></pre>
<p><img src="lab03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 5</strong></p>
<p>Compare the boxplots and histograms we just made.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What sorts of things seem easier to do with the boxplots as opposed
to histograms? Think about what features of the data might be easier to
see with a boxplot and what comparisons might be easier to make using a
boxplot.</li>
<li>Do you lose anything by using a boxplot instead of a histogram? Are
there any important features of the data that are harder to see in the
boxplot?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="section-summarizing-the-data-numerically"
class="section level3">
<h3>Summarizing the data numerically</h3>
<p>Finally, let’s use R to get a numerical summary of the lifespans of
the rats under the two diets. In the first part of the session, we
focused on the <em>mean</em> and <em>standard deviation</em> (and
<em>variance</em>), but we have also seen that the <em>median</em> and
<em>inter-quartile range</em> (IQR) can also be used as numerical
summaries of central tendency and variability.</p>
<p>R can find the median and IQR for us:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rats %&gt;%
    group_by(Diet) %&gt;%
    summarize(Median = median(Lifespan), IQR = IQR(Lifespan))</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["Diet"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Median"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["IQR"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Free","2":"710.0","3":"116.00"},{"1":"Restricted","2":"1035.5","3":"300.25"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 6</strong></p>
<p>Fill in the blanks in the following chunk of code to find the mean
and standard deviation of the lifespans of the rats under each diet.
<em>Hint:</em> recall the names of the functions we used to find these
quantities earlier.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="rat_num" data-completion="0"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>___ %&gt;%
    group_by(___) %&gt;%
    ___(Mean = ___, SD = ___)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":true,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Compare the means and standard deviations for each group of rats to
the histograms we made earlier. How are the differences in mean lifespan
between groups reflected in the two histograms? How are the differences
in the standard deviation of lifespan reflected in the two
histograms?</p>
<hr />
<p>These numerical summaries of central tendency and variability provide
a concise description of the lifespans of rats under the two different
diets. These descriptions help us address the <strong>research
question</strong>: does a restricted diet have an effect on
lifespan?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise 7</strong></p>
<p>Based on the visual and numerical summaries we have made, let us draw
some conclusions about that research question.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Briefly describe the differences in lifespans between rats under a
restricted diet versus rats with a free diet.</li>
<li>Based on the design of the study, can we conclude that the
differences in diet may have played a role in <em>causing</em> the
observed differences in lifespan in this sample? Why or why not?</li>
<li>What is the population to which you think we could
<em>generalize</em> these results?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-wrap-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>In this session, we saw how to find two important numerical summaries
of variability: <strong>variance</strong> and <strong>standard
deviation</strong>. We analyzed data from an experiment studying the
relationship between diet and lifespan in a sample of rats, using both
visual and numerical summaries to get a more complete picture of the
relationships between explanatory and response variables.
